Hi there 👋👋 !

My name is Ruxi Gu (辜汝曦), I'm currently a junior undergraduate student at the [School of Cyber Science and Engineering (SCSE)](http://cse.whu.edu.cn/index.htm), [Wuhan University (WHU)](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), pursuing a B.E. degree in Cyberspace Security. I graduated from Wuhan Foreign Languages School(WFLS).

My research interest lies in Artificial Intelligence (AI) Security & Privacy, where I explore the weakness of Deep Learning models in their lifecycles (e.g., Adversarial Attack, Backdoor Attack) and their countermeasures. I also made efforts on turning these weaknesses into good use, applying on privacy protection and Intellectual Property (IP) protection of deep learning models. I am a member of [NIS&P Lab](http://nisplab.whu.edu.cn/). 

I have won the First Class Scholarship of WHU 2 times (5% school-wide), the HUANG Zhangren Scholarship (60 candidates per year in WHU), the Huawei Scholarship (54 candidates per year in WHU), the National Scholarship (0.2% national-wide), and was selected the Pacemaker to Merit Student of WHU (60 candidates per year in WHU). I was awarded 🏅️ the **Gold Reward** of [The 8th China International College Students 'Internet+' Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition](https://cy.ncss.cn/), the highest and most valuable competition award for Chinese college students (national-wide, refer to [this link](https://news.eol.cn/yaowen/202103/t20210322_2087129.shtml)), as the co-founder of the team.

🌟🌟 I'm currently actively seeking for Ph.D., Research Assistant, or internship positions related to Information Security or AI. If you're interested in working with me, don't hesitate to drop me an email. 

My curriculum vitae can be downloaded [here (in English)](https://github.com/AntigoneRandy/antigonerandy.github.io/raw/main/docs/Boheng_Li_s_CV.pdf).
